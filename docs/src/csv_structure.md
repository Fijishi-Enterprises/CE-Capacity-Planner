## Personal Data Setup
### Folder Structure
- costs.csv
- nodes.csv
- techs.yml
- lines.csv - optional
- TS - subfolder containing time-series-data
- > [timeseries name].csv

### Time Series data

| `Timestamp`| `year` | [nodes...] |
|----------|------|------|
| [some iterator]| relative value of installed capacity for renewables or absolute values for demand or so |
|...| ...|

### costs.csv
!!! note
    The different LCA-impact category columns define the `impact`-set. The different years within the column `year` define the `year`-set.

| `tech`  |  `year` | `account` |[currency] | [LCA-Impact categories...] |
|-------|-------|---------|-----------|------------|
|[tech]| year of this price | `cap` or `fix` or `var` |Cost per unit Power(MW) or Energy (MWh) | Emissions per unit Power(MW) or Energy (MWh)...|
|...    | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### nodes.csv
!!! note
    The different nodes within the column `node` define the `node`-set

|`node`|`region`|`infrastruct`|`lon` | `lat`|[`techs`...] |
|-------|--------|------------|------|------|-------------|
|[node...]|region of this node| `ex` - existing or `lim` - limiting capacity| Latitude in °| Longitude in °| installed capacity of each tech at this node in MW or MWh|
|...| ...| ...|...| ...|

### techs.yml
!!! note
    The technologies within the group `techs` define the `tech`-set

!!! note
    The currently supported technology-groups are
    - `demand`: For example the electricity demand
    - `non_dispatchable_generation`: For generation technologies like e.g. PV, wind
    - `dispatchable_generation`: For generation technologies like gas
    - `storage`: A technology that stores e.g. electricity or hydrogen
    - `conversion`: A technology that converts from one carrier to another
    - `transmission`: For transmission technologies that have no capacity (`CAP`) per `node`, but capacities (`TRANS`)  per `line`

!!! note
    The implementation of storage typically needs the conversion from one carrier like electricity to another carrier like hydrogen. The integration of a carrier technology allows more complex energy systems. A single storage technology like hydrogen can be connected with one technology that converts electricity to hydrogen and another technology that runs a solar powered electrolysis.

`techs.yml` needs to have the following structure:
- `tech_groups`: defines parent groups for techs or other tech_groups
- `techs`: defines the technologies, the elements are used to declare the dimension `tech`
We allow technologies to have parents to reduce unnecessary and mistake enabling repetitions within the `techs.yml`-file. The information of the single techs is combined with the information provided from their parent tech_groups. One technology can have multiple tech_groups, if the parent has a parent. The combined information must contain:
- `name`: A detailed description of the technology
- `tech_group`: a technology-group that the technology belongs to. Groups can be: `demand`, `generation`, `dispatchable_generation`, `non_dispatchable_generation`, `storage`, `conversion`, `transmission`
- `plant_lifetime`: the physical expected lifetime of this technologies plant [a]
- `financial_lifetime`: financial time to break even [a]
- `discount_rate`: discount rate for technology [a]
- `structure`: `node` or `line` depending on the structure of the technology
- `unit`: the unit that the capacity of the technology scales with. It can be `power`[MW] or `energy`[MWh]
- `input`: the input can be a `carrier` like e.g. electricity, a `timeseries` like e.g. `timeseries: demand_electricity`, or a `fuel` like e.g. `fuel: gas`
The information can contain:
- `constraints`: like an `efficiency` like e.g. `efficiency: 0.53` or `cap_eq` (e.g. discharge capacity is same as charge capacity) `cap_eq: bat_in`

### lines.csv
!!! note
    The different lines within the column `line` define the `line`-set

!!! note
    Each `node_start` and `node_end` has to be a `node` in the file `nodes.csv`.

|`line`|`node_start`|`node_end`|`reactance`|`resistance`|`power_ex`|`power_lim`|`voltage`|`circuits`|`length`|
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
|[line...]|`node` - line starts| `node` - line ends| reactance| resistance| existing capacity in MW | capacity limit in MW| voltage or description| number of circuits included| length in km|
|...| ...| ...|...| ...|...| ...| ...|...| ...|
